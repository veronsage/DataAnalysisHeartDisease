# DataAnalysisHeartDisease
This repository contains the practice of analyzing data on a dataset on heart diseases
Data Description
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
•	age <br />
•	sex <br />
•	cp = chest pain type (4 values) <br />
•	trestbps = resting blood pressure <br />
•	chol = serum cholestoral in mg/dl <br />
•	fbs = fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl <br />
•	restecg = resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2) <br />
•	thalach = maximum heart rate achieved <br />
•	exang = exercise induced angina <br />
•	oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest <br />
•	slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment <br />
•	ca = number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy <br />
•	thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect <br />
•	target:0 for no presence of heart disease, 1 for presence of heart disease <br />
