# DataAnalysisHeartDisease
This repository contains the practice of analyzing data on a dataset on heart diseases
Data Description
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
•	age
•	sex
•	cp = chest pain type (4 values)
•	trestbps = resting blood pressure
•	chol = serum cholestoral in mg/dl
•	fbs = fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
•	restecg = resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
•	thalach = maximum heart rate achieved
•	exang = exercise induced angina
•	oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
•	slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
•	ca = number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
•	thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
•	target:0 for no presence of heart disease, 1 for presence of heart disease
